🌐 Live Demo: https://vertexly.vercel.app

🚀 Introduction

Vertexly is redefining how Indian businesses go online.
Where AI website builders fail to deliver localized, affordable, and human-assisted solutions, Vertexly bridges the gap — offering customizable, ready-to-launch websites at a fraction of the cost.

We don’t just build websites.
💡 We build digital identities for India’s small businesses.

⚠️ The Problem with AI Website Builders

Modern AI website builders like Durable, Framer, and 10Web promise quick site creation,
but they often fail for Indian businesses because of:

❌ Limitation	⚙️ AI Builders	✅ Vertexly
Customization	Limited	Fully Customizable
Language Support	English Only	Hindi + English
Pricing	$10–$25/month	₹500 One-time
Customer Support	No Human Help	Real Human Support via WhatsApp
Delivery Time	Instant (Low Quality)	48 Hours (High Quality)

AI is fast ⚡, but not personal.
Vertexly merges automation + human touch 🤝 to build meaningful, accurate, and culturally relevant websites.

💡 Why Vertexly is Different from Traditional Web Agencies

Typical agencies charge ₹10,000–₹50,000 per website
and take weeks to deliver — often without transparency or post-delivery support.

Vertexly changes that 👇

💼 Agency	💻 Vertexly
Expensive (₹10k–₹50k)	Affordable (₹500–₹2,000)
Weeks to deliver	48 Hours Delivery
Complicated onboarding	3-step Simple Process
No updates/support	Free WhatsApp Support
Manual hosting	Auto-Hosted Websites

We make website creation as easy as ordering a meal online. 🍔
